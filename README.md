# votinginference

Use the results from a pair of successive general elections to
infer how voters changed their allegiances from one party to another.

That is, there are simultaneous elections in a large number
constituencies on two separate dates. We know how many people ended
up voting for each party, but we'd also like to know the flows of
votes from party A to party B for all (A,B).
